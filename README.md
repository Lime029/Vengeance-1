# Vengeance-v19
A role-playing game created in RPG Maker XP using the scripting language Ruby (RGSS). It uses the public template Pokemon Essentials v19.1 (https://github.com/Maruno17/pokemon-essentials) as a base and I have developed substantially upon it to include many new attributes and features.
